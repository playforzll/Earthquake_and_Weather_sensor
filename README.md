This code works by python.
This project needs internet to use.

I used USGS earthquake api to work earthquake data.
I used openweathermap api to work weather data.

ğŸ‘‰If you want to make weather work you must log in or sign up and get your api key or else It will show an error.ğŸ‘ˆ

ğŸ‘‰Go to main.py and download to make this code work.ğŸ‘ˆ

If you have any great ideas please share to us.
